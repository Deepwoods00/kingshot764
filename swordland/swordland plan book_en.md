## Part 0: General Principles & Guidelines

### Responsibilities
- When their assigned defensive structures are not under pressure, Supporters can look for offensive opportunities or fill defensive gaps on the battlefield.
- Apart from the 5 Supporters, all other members should operate as a squad; avoid moving alone as much as possible.
- The main task for each squad is to garrison structures. If personal troop strength allows, they can attack enemy cities to force opponents to TP back to their spawn, thus reducing defensive pressure.
- After a structure is captured, it is necessary to collect the scattered points around it.
- When Undercellars appear, troops can be sent to gather from them depending on the defensive pressure.

### Battlefield Tips
- Marches on the battlefield can be sped up. Click on a marching army in the left-side panel to find a free speed-up option.
- After your own city is attacked, you can use 100 gems to extinguish the fire. This method can greatly reduce reliance on TPs and enhance the sustainability of your defense.
- How to exit the battlefield to recover troops: Click the event title at the top of the screen, where there will be an exit button. However, there is a 12-minute cooldown before you can re-enter.

## Part 1: Opening Phase Battle Plan

### I. Core Strategic Concept

- Our strategy is to secure all objectives on our side of the map without fail, while concentrating our elite forces for a decisive strike on the enemy's core objective (their Sanctum). At the same time, we will maintain a strategic reserve force, ready to reinforce any weak points or seize offensive opportunities.


### II. Squad Role Assignments

#### 1. Defense Core: Our Sanctum
* **Unit Assigned:** **Zurn1451 + Squad 1**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP directly near our Sanctum and garrison your troops.

#### 2. Strategic Points Group: Bell Tower & Stables
* **Unit Assigned (Bell Tower):** **ALI + Squad 2**
* **Unit Assigned (Stables):** **Le Ben + Squad 4**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP next to your assigned objective and attempt to capture it. After capture, switch to a defensive posture. If the capture fails, prepare to reinforce our side's defense or find other capturable objectives.

#### 3. Core Strike Group: Enemy Sanctum
* **Unit Assigned:** **MailoBoy + Squad 3**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP directly next to the enemy Sanctum and conduct harassment. Capturing it is ideal; if captured, switch to a defensive posture.

#### 4. Strategic Reserve
* **Unit Assigned:** **Phycotickiller07 + Squad 5**
* **Core Directive:** Squad 5 and Phycotickiller will remain at the spawn point on standby at the start of the match. Based on the battlefield situation, execute the following tasks in order of priority:
    1.  **Primary Mission (Defense):** Reinforce any weakly defended friendly structures, especially our Sanctum.
    2.  **Secondary Mission (Offense):** When the situation is stable, proactively seek opportunities to harass or capture weakly defended enemy structures.

#### 5. Base Capture Group: Our Abbeys
* **Unit Assigned:** **Squad 6 & Squad 7**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, Squad 6 will TP to a midpoint between the far Abbey and the functional building, positioning closer to the Abbey. After capturing it, assist in the defense of our nearby functional building (Bell Tower or Stables). Squad 7 will not TP at the start. Remain at the spawn and send troops to capture the nearby Abbey. After capture, decide whether to reinforce an ally or harass the enemy based on the situation.

## Part 2: Mid- & Late-Game Battle Plan

### I. Core Strategic Concept

We will assemble a super assault squad led by two Supporters to take the Swordshrine as the main objective. Simultaneously, our most threatening force behind enemy lines will continue to apply pressure to pin down enemy troops. The remaining units will switch to defense to consolidate our advantages. If the defense is under great strain, we can preserve troops and attack weak enemy structures, on the condition that we operate as squads.

### II. Squad Role Assignments

#### 1. Central Main Assault Group
* **Unit Assigned:** **Zurn1451 + Phycotickiller07 + Squad 5**
* **Core Directive:**
    1.  Form a "dual-core" super assault squad. Assemble in the mid-field before the Swordshrine opens.
    2.  Zurn is responsible for providing the garrison buff, while Phyco's main task is to attack enemy cities to force them to TP back to their spawn.
    3.  Objective Swordshrine: As soon as the structure opens, launch the first wave of attack to secure the first-capture bonus.

#### 2. Strategic Pressure Group
* **Unit Assigned:** **MailoBoy + Squad 3**
* **Core Directive:**
    1.  Continue to operate behind enemy lines, maintaining high-intensity harassment and offensive pressure on high-value targets like the enemy Sanctum or Mercenary buildings.
    2.  Your mission is to pin down the enemy's main force to create an advantage for our forces in the central battlefield.

#### 3. Absolute Defense Core
* **Unit Assigned:** **ALI + Squad 1**
* **Core Directive:**
    1.  Take over from Zurn to defend our Sanctum.
    2.  Your mission is to hold this highest-value rear objective.

#### 4. Functional Buildings & Mobile Defense Group
* **Unit Assigned:** **Le Ben + Squad 4** (Stables Group) & **Squad 2** (Bell Tower Group)
* **Core Directive:**
    1.  The primary mission is to defend the **Bell Tower** and **Stables**.
    2.  In a dire situation where forces must be concentrated to defend the core area (our Sanctum), these two functional buildings can be the **first objectives to be abandoned**, with personnel pulling back to assist in the defense.

#### 5. Rear Support Group
* **Unit Assigned:** **Squad 6 & Squad 7**
* **Core Directive:**
    1.  Hold your positions and defend the two Abbeys to provide a steady stream of base points for the team.
    2.  As the Abbeys are constant point generators, they should be held at all costs unless the entire defensive line collapses.

### III. Mid- & Late-Game Deployment Summary Table

| Task Group | Assigned Units | Core Objective | Tactical Directive |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Central Main Assault** | **Zurn + Phyco + Squad 5** | **Swordshrine** | Dual-Core, Assault and Hold |
| **Strategic Pressure** | **MailoBoy + Squad 3** | **Enemy High-Value Objectives** | Apply pressure behind enemy lines, pin down main forces |
| **Absolute Defense** | **ALI + Squad 1** | **Our Sanctum** | Take over defense, secure the rear |
| **Mobile Defense** | **Le Ben + Squad 4, Squad 2** | **Bell Tower & Stables** | Guard functional buildings, **prepare to shrink the line** |
| **Rear Support** | **Squad 6 & Squad 7** | **Abbeys** | **Hold scoring objectives**, act as the last line of defense |
