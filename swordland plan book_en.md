# Swordland Showdown: Opening Phase Battle Plan
---

## 1. Core Strategic Concept

- Our strategy is to secure all objectives on our side of the map without fail, while concentrating our elite forces for a decisive strike on the enemy's core objective (their Sanctum). At the same time, we will maintain a strategic reserve force, ready to reinforce any weak points or seize offensive opportunities.
- Aside from the 5 Supporters, all other members must operate as squads. Avoid moving alone.

## 2. Squad Role Assignments

### 1. Defense Core: Our Sanctum
* **Unit Assigned:** **Zurn1451 + Squad 1**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP (Teleport) directly near our Sanctum and garrison your troops.

### 2. Strategic Points Group: Bell Tower & Stables
* **Unit Assigned (Bell Tower):** **ALI + Squad 2**
* **Unit Assigned (Stables):** **Le Ben + Squad 4**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP next to your assigned objective and attempt to capture it. After capture, switch to a defensive posture. If the capture fails, prepare to reinforce our side's defense or find other capturable objectives.

### 3. Core Strike Group: Enemy Sanctum
* **Unit Assigned:** **MailoBoy + Squad 3**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, TP directly next to the enemy Sanctum and conduct harassment. Capturing it is ideal; if captured, switch to a defensive posture.

### 4. Strategic Reserve
* **Unit Assigned:** **Phycotickiller07 + Squad 5**
* **Core Directive:** Squad 5 and Phycotickiller will remain at the spawn point on standby at the start of the match. Based on the battlefield situation, execute the following tasks in order of priority:
    1.  **Primary Mission (Defense):** Reinforce any weakly defended friendly structures, especially our Sanctum.
    2.  **Secondary Mission (Offense):** When the situation is stable, proactively seek opportunities to harass or capture weakly defended enemy structures.

### 5. Base Capture Group: Our Abbeys
* **Unit Assigned:** **Squad 6 & Squad 7**
* **Core Directive:** At the start, Squad 6 will TP to a midpoint between the far Abbey and the functional building, positioning closer to the Abbey. After capturing it, assist in the defense of our nearby functional building (Bell Tower or Stables). Squad 7 will not TP at the start. Remain at the spawn and send troops to capture the nearby Abbey. After capture, decide whether to reinforce an ally or harass the enemy based on the situation.
