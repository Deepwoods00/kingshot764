# Castle Battle - Notes

## Objective
- Our objective is to attack and occupy Turret 2.

## Rules
- Please follow instructions; do not initiate rallies on your own.
- Be sure to use the correct heroes. Using the wrong heroes may result in being removed from the rally.
- Pay attention to healing your troops in batches. Healing instructions are at the end of this document.

## Tips
- Before the battle, save your troop formation. This will save a lot of time and effort.
- Maintain communication. For example, if someone has scouted the target, please share the report in the alliance chat.

## Hero Usage
#### Offense
- For offensive rallies, use Chenko, Yeonwoo, or Amane as your squad leader.
- Use a troop composition of 5:2:3 (Infantry : Cavalry : Archer).
- Only use troops of Tier 8 and above.
- Among the heroes mentioned above, use the one with the highest level for their top-right skill.

#### Defense
- After capturing the objective, you will need to switch heroes by recalling and resending your troops. Please wait for the command to recall; do not recall on your own.
- For defensive garrisons, use Howard, Gordon, or Fahd as your squad leader.
- Use a troop composition of 6:2:2 (Infantry : Cavalry : Archer).
- Only use troops of Tier 8 and above.
- Among the heroes mentioned above, use the one with the highest level for their top-right skill.
- After our garrison is attacked, we need to reinforce it. Those already in the garrison should send a troop dispatch **without a hero** to the garrison.

## Healing Method
- **Do not** heal all wounded troops at once.
- On the healing page, select a number of troops to heal so that the healing time is between 15-30 minutes. The purpose of this is to have the healing process complete instantly after requesting help from allies.
- Repeat step 2 until all wounded troops are healed.
